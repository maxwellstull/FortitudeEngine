# Fortitude Engine
Fortitude Engine is an engine I am making to be used in the creation of tower defense games. 
### Inspiration
I've wanted to create games for a while as a hobby, and have tried using engines like Unreal. However, I was not a fan of all of the bulky overhead, and the node connecting. I wanted a game engine that was as heavy-duty as I needed, and mainly, *that used actually programming.*
### Motivation
The motivation behind creating this game engine and game is to eventually create a tower defense game and publish it on Steam. I also wanted to learn more about game development, such as how input is handled, and the overall functionality of a "game loop". 
### Engine Goals
The goal of the engine is to provide an easy-to-use and uncumbersome library to interact with to make tower defense games. The thought behind it is that whoever uses it would slightly edit the library to adjust it to the needs. The code is meant to be easily interpretable, and not full of what we see so often in C++ libraries where you need Bjarne Stroustrup to help you read it.

## Todo
### Tasks
#### Restructure how menus are made
- Pass in options, sub-options, size, function pointers, etc.
- Layouts will be made automatically
  - Method for manual layout too
#### Achievements
- Create basic implementation of first achievement. Figure out how to tag it onto something

#### Tower base class
- Damage type
#### Enemy base class

### Features

#### Procedural/random map generation
- Create random map and place random houses, blocks, etc
#### Map of the Day
- Using procedural maps, have map of the day with leaderboard that tracks highest wave
